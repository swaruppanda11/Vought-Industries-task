## Transforming Vought Showcase into a Story Viewer

This is my submission of the task given. I did the following changes as per the requiremnts -

1. Replaced UIPageControl with SegmentedProgressBar (provided in the zip file) at the top of the screen.
2. Remove swipe gestures; instead, automatically show the next member when a segment's progress is complete.
3. Convert the UI to full-screen.
4. Replace The Seven members with The Boys.
5. Implement tapping on right/left corners to show next/previous members, ensuring the segmented progress bar updates accordingly.
6. Handle status bar styling as needed.


The changes are implemented in a separate branch named - 'Story-like-animation'
